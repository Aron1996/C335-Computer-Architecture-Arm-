Question 1:
It has 14 pins:  
Vdd_IO: Power supply for I/O pins
SCL: Signal interface I2C serial clock (SCL)
SDA: Signal interface I2C serial data (SDA)
INT2: Inertial Interrupt 2
INT1: Inertial Interrupt 1
C1:   Reserved capacitor connection (C1)
GND:  0 V supply
Reserved: Leave unconnected
DRDY:	  Data ready
Reserved: Connect to GND
Reserved: Connect to GND
SETP:	  S/R capacitor connection (C2)
SETC:	  S/R capacitor connection (C2)
Vdd:	  Power supply
volts are from 2.16v to 3.6v
It's in the top right of the list of pins.

Q2) Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing? HINT: LOOK AT THE COMMENTS

We want to configure the return and function. The accelerometer specifies the power, axis, update frequency, little/bid endian, sesitivity and other modes.The magnetometer configures the temp sensor, output rate, scale and conversion rate.

Q3) What do the following lines of code do? (it is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)

The loop is reading the x,y,z axis and shift left of 8 to save it in accel_data[i]

Q4.) Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?
It is necessary because if board is upside down the number will be reversed. Without compensating for the tilt the upsidedown reading will give an error. 

Difficulties:

We met the difficulties with drawing the line to show North. The fact is it's highly impossible to implment that because we need to redraw the line every second. So we choose alternate way to visualize the direction to print where is the North with light on LED in that direction.
