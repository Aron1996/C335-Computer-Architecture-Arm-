Q1) In previous labs, adding a peripheral has required pin initializations. Why were able to add the nunchuk without initializing anything?
I2c has already initialize those pins. We can use previous configuration.

Q2) What are the major differences between these two functions and what does that imply about communicating with the nunchuk?
Nunchuk the mode is AutoEnd_Mode, which means that the nunchuk could listen automatically. So the data send from 0x00, and I2c1 send data from register. 

Q3) What do all of these variables correspond to in the nunchuk?
jx: Joystick Up/Down
jy: Joystick Left/Right
ax: movement in x axis
ay: movement in y axis 
az: movement in z axis
C: C button
Z: Z button

Q4) Explain the code above.
data[5] & 0x03 give the first two bits data[5]
The first is z button and next is c button. 
So case 0 is 0b00
   case 1 is 0b01
   case 2 is 0b10
   case 3 is 0b11

Difficulties: The range of nunchuk is difficult to figure out. And the board sometimes is not working so I need to reboot it few times.
