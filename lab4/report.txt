How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
3, One for Uart connection and two for TX, RX

What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
Alternate function can be used in different purposes in same pin

Define "baud rate" in your own words.
Speed of transmiting data per second. 

Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
Newlib_stubs provides standard in and standard out to be the board. The prinf function by default will call stdin. 
So if there is no newlib_stubs, printf won't work because it don't go through the board.

What did you learn, any difficulties you had.

I learned a method to debug by using UART and Logic Analyzer. UART can give me what the code I transmitted to the board and give back the information from board. I met diffculities on the make file but I figure it out by restart everything and pull previous lab file from github.
