Results:
   I finish the mywc.c small program that could count the words in a file, and we also work together to figure out how poly works.
   I understand the content in memory address and the differences between integer and other types of data.

Diffculties:
   I can't understand the memory address can store more than one content at the beginning, and I also have no idea where to start.
   So I ask AI about the content in memory and he gave me detailed explanation. I figure it out quickly because of his effort.

Something I learned:
   The most important thing I learned from this lab is the memory address and its related field. I know Integer are stored in four bytes, short in two bytes and so on. I also learned a lot with make file.
